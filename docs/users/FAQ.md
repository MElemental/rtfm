# FAQ

## What is SYN Shop?

SYN Shop is a [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) located in Henderson, Nevada. It is a space 
for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, 
learning. Our motto is: "Let's make stuff awesome!"

The group tends to be focused on electronics. However, many members do metal working, 
programming, wood working, crafting, and a variety of other things. Synshop provides a 
fertile environment and community that is passionate about learning, helping others, 
and growing the community of hackers/makers/tinkerers/geeks in Las Vegas. We also like 
to meet people from other hackerspaces, and have seen people visit SYN Shop from 
hackerspaces world wide.

## What is the best time to visit SYN Shop?

Come on down when ever we're open! Our hours are:

* Monday: 6pm - 10pm DIY Robot Domination
* Tuesday:  6pm - 10pm  Craft night, Community night
* Wednesday: 6pm - 10pm 
* Thursday 6pm - 10pm
* Friday 6pm - 10pm
* Saturday: 3pm - 10pm
* Sunday: Closed 

Mondays and Tuesdays are themed after interest groups. If you come to work, your project 
does not have to match the theme. However these nights tend to attract members of the community 
that are interested in that theme. DIY Robot Domination attracts robotics enthusiasts. Craft Night
 attracts "Team Low Tech" and all others who are interested in a variety of general crafts. Think 
 of a knitting circle where one person knits, one person builds models, and another sews a quilt.

You do not need to be a member to come spend time and acclimate yourself. You do need to be a member to use our equipment.
