# Unifi VM

**NOT CURRENTLY INSTALLED - PLEASE UPDATE WHEN VM/LXC IS REDEPLOYED**

Otherwise, we have 3 Unifi APs that would be controlled by [Unifi Software](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/220066768-Updating-and-Installing-Self-Hosted-UniFi-Network-Servers-Linux) running on a linux host of some sort.  

However, after they're set up, you don't need the Unifi software running, hence why it's OK (enough) that this is not currently running.
