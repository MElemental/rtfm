#  VPN

We have a Wireguard VPN running on a wee router: [GL-AR150](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-ar150/). To create an account:

1. get the login from the password vault
2. login on the device (IP is on a label on the device in the server rack)
3. Go to Wireguard VPN server
4. Add a client with a good name like "Joe's laptop"
5. View the client config and securely transmit the info to the new user
