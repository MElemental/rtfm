rtfm site is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).  To update them:

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [rtfm](https://github.com/synshop/rtfm) repo to your user on github
* Go to your copy of the repo (eg https://github/USERNAME/rtfm) and clone it
* if you haven't already, install [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation) on your local machine.
* create a branch, make your edits
* run "mkdocs build" and verify that the changes look good locally.
* commit your changes them and push the branch up to your github rtfm repo
* create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for your branch against master on the main [rtfm](https://github.com/synshop/rtfm) repo

A SYN Shop member will review and merge your request if it all looks good!
